# 👋 Hey there! I'm Phương  

I'm a **Junior Backend Developer** on paper, but really... I'm a **full-stack dev in the making** 😎  
I code servers with **C# & ASP.NET Core**, shape databases with **SQL Server & PostgreSQL**, and talk to the frontend with clean **RESTful APIs** (and yes, I document them with Swagger like a pro).

But hey, I’m not just about the backend — I can build slick UIs with **Next.js**, or go old-school with **HTML/CSS/JS**. I even dabble in **Flutter** for mobile dev. Versatile? You bet.
